  <p>Now, about the advantages of&nbsp;an&nbsp;outsourced employee, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;class.</p>
  <p>🦸🏻‍♂️ Most importantly, the employer saves well.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>On&nbsp;a&nbsp;computer and workplace furniture. Up&nbsp;to&nbsp;$4000.</li>
    <li>On&nbsp;taxes. An&nbsp;outsourced employee, registered as&nbsp;an&nbsp;individual entrepreneur, pays for himself.</li>
    <li>On&nbsp;office rent. Even a&nbsp;place in&nbsp;coworking costs from $140 per month. And in&nbsp;the business center, it ’s <span class="nobr">2–3</span> times higher.</li>
    <li>At&nbsp;the office supplies. Up&nbsp;to&nbsp;$90 per year.</li>
    <li>On&nbsp;coffee, tea, and other office cookies.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>🦸🏻‍♂️ The second, non-obvious plus of&nbsp;remote employees is&nbsp;strict control. The employer fears that the freelancer will not be&nbsp;productive without supervision and sets strict regulations. On&nbsp;daily conference calls, the team reports on&nbsp;what they did yesterday and makes plans for today. On&nbsp;weekly conference calls, they plan for the next sprint. Two times a&nbsp;month, they show intermediate results to&nbsp;stakeholders. And some prefer <a href="https://www.toptal.com/tracker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">time trackers</a> that take screenshots of&nbsp;a&nbsp;freelancer at&nbsp;any time.</p>
  <p>🦹🏻‍♂️ The only negative is&nbsp;isolation from the team, low involvement in&nbsp;the corporate culture and less loyalty to&nbsp;the employer. But this problem is&nbsp;also solvable. For example, by&nbsp;inviting freelancers to&nbsp;an&nbsp;annual corporate party.</p>
